          <header>Key Experience</header>
          <p>One important "a-ha" moment I had during this class was that you don't understand in the beginning you just do it that you will eventually understand.</p>
          <p>Another important learning experiences during this class was that coding is hard to understand and that you really have to dig deep to understand.        
          </p>
<ul>
  <li>Learned that coding will eventually get easier but you have to just push through.</li>
  <li>I also learned that Web design has a lot more coding than I thought in the beginning of class.</li>
  <li>Learned that once you understand html copying and pasting makes your work a lot easier and faster. Important to work fast.</li>
</ul>

          <header>What Worked/Didn't</header>
          <p> One of the things that worked in the class was the extra help during class.Another thing that worked was the class time too work was very helpful. Lastly, The links and use of other websites help with assignments</p>
          <p>One things that didn't really work was the class felt like a freecodecamp class. Another thing was I would like more learning from instructor than from freecodecamp, its was easier to learn through instructor than through a computer. Lastly, Did a lot of on your own reasearch.</p>

          <ul>
  <li>Learning code is hard and you just have to power throught it a little bit.</li>
  <li>Web design is how you can add your designs into code</li>
  <li>You can have the coolest design ever but if you can't implement it into code than it doesn't help.</li>
</ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Skills">
          <header>Connections</header>
          <p>I would rarely talk about this class outside of class because it was more of on your own freecodecamp and everyone is doing that same thing so nothing really to talk about.</p>
          <p>I have became curious of how web designer were about to overcome being able to actually build websites like how they envisioned</p>
          <p> This class connect with a lot of classes like ux and typography class.
</p>
          <p> No it was more on your own work.</p>

          <p>What was fun was being able to implement some of the stuff your learn. Learning something new. </p>
          <p>What was useful was the extra websites and links to help. The in class talks helped would would like it to be longer. </p>
          <p>One random fact that I learned this quarter is that code is hard.</p>
          <p>I have gain knowledge and able to understand html which is crazy because in the beginning the codes looked like a bunch of random stuff</p>
